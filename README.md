# sklearn-transformer-extensions

This python package attempts to make building end-to-end pipelines using
scikit-learn and pandas DataFrames easier and more intuitive. It provides a
collection of new classes (XyAdapter) and drop-in replacements of some existing
scikit-learn classes (ColumnTransformer, FunctionTransformer) that work
together to make it very easy to build very sophisticated scikit-learn
pipelines with ease. Besides, there are no functional limitations to using this
new working - anything that can be achieved with the original scikit-learn API
like cross-validation, grid-search, etc - is also achievable with this new
work.
